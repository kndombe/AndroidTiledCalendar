/**
 * A month view calendar that allows to customize each month cell by adding tiles
 * with a custom text.
 *
 * The user of this interface has the possibility to add an <code>Entry</code> or list
 * <code>List</code> of <code>Entry</code>s that will be used in displaying the <code>Tile</code>s
 * in the month view.
 *
 * Since <code>Entry</code> is an interface, there is a need to have a class that implements the
 * <code>Entry</code> interface and overrides all necessary methods. The user of the interface has
 * the choice to use a custom class that does those things.
 * However, the user also has the choice to use the <code>EntryFactory#makeEntry</code> method to
 * directly create an instance that they can store in a variable of type <code>Entry</code>, without
 * needing to create a custom class implementing <code>Entry</code>.
 * e.g. <code>Entry entry = EntryFactory.makeEntry(...)</code>
 *
 * The tiles will be displayed from top to bottom following 3 rules of comparisons: 1) which
 * <code>Entry</code> has the earliest <code>Entry#getStartDateTime</code>, unless these are equal,
 * then 2) which <code>Entry</code> has the earliest <code>Entry#getEndDateTime</code>, unless these
 * are equal, then 3) which <code>Entry</code> has the smallest <code>Entry#getName</code>
 * lexicographically.
 * Depending on the height available for the view, each cell will only contain up to a certain
 * number of visible <code>Tile</code>s. If there's more available <code>Tile</code>s, those will be
 * present but simply not fully visible.
 *
 * The user of the calendar should use <code>#setTiledMonthEventListener</code> to set a listener
 * for the different actions that would be happening within the calendar like date selection, month
 * change and swipes.
